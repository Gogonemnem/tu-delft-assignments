# Point of improvement from last week

- Database should be finished (before Wednesday)
- Link agenda with randomizer
- Maybe add buttons, one button to add activity in agenda, one for adding task
- We have to start writing code for the Task status
- Merge everything before Tuesday afternoon

# What went well?

- Task distribution last week:
    - Betsie: finish randomizer, write code to save list
        - Betsie worked on the randomizer. She has yet to begin to write a test. Nils and Betsie have to make one combined file for the randomizer and to do list.
    - Cristian: work on pop-up notification, work on input agenda
        - Cristian worked on the input for the agenda. Gonem finished this part. Cristian is still working on the pop-up. This takes more time than he first thought. Maybe add a suggestion for the taks id so it is more clear for the user.
    - Nils: start task status
        - Nils Worked on the to-do list and the task status. A few adjustments need to be made to clean up the source files. Furthermore, the path needs to be adjusted to be able to work on Mac.
    - Janine: finish database, save activities in something like a dataframe
        - Janine wrote tests for the database and some for the agenda and made adjustments for the input for the agenda. Gonem finished the input for the agenda.
    - Merge everything to the main before Tuesday 16 o clock online
        - We merged most of the branches in time for the TA to check the code and give feedback

# What could improve?

- Last week we didn't meet on campus, so there were some communication problems, and preferences for input and output weren't coordinated properly;
- The architecture and design of the application need to be more refined. All parts of the code need a proper review to check if everything is according to the rules and all parts are understandable for everyone. Add comments with functions why the function exists.

# How do we proceed?

- Feedback on the report needs to be processed;
- Parts of the code that need to be finished:
    - To do list;
    - Pop-up window;
    - task status;
    - Time randomizer
- Test to create:
    - Randomizer
    - To do list
    - Time randomizer
