# What went well?

- Janine began with the task database, it has all the attributes. Added a function to connect with the add task widget.
- Betsie has a python file with code that randomizes the database. Betsie now knows how the randomizer package works! the 4 priorities are now in order, so high priority is first, but the tasks in high priority are hustled so you don't know which high priority is first. Gonem, had the idea to give all priorities numbers and based on the chance to get the priority on the day. This means that it is more likely to have a high priority on the day but there is also a chance to have a low priority. Nils,
- Nils made a preliminary design for the application with different widgets. Nils knows how it works and can make different layouts for different needs
- Gonem had no problems with programming. Now it needs to be connected with different functions. Problem is that PYQT5 doesn't have a day calendar so we need to find a workaround for that.

# What could improve?

- It's hard to see what everyone does. To improve, we make a planning on Mondays for the week.
- We didn't yet start using milestones.
- Every week we have effectively two short sprints (Monday to Wednesday and Thursday to Monday) instead of one sprint.

# How do we proceed?

- To improve, we make a planning on Mondays for the intire week.
- The part of code that is worked on has to be done by Monday so every Monday all new parts can be merged into the main branch
- From today on we will be using milestones
