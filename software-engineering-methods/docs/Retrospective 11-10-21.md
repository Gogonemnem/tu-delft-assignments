# Points of improvement from last Week

- Everyone needs to update the status of their issues. Keeping up with milestones and branches in real-time
- We will create more merge requests and more branches. We need to split the issues up into smaller issues and giving them their own issues & branches
- We will merge our finished products into main. However, it is not clear when we should push things to main? Does it need to be completely done, free from foreseeable bugs, and free of comments (such as TODO, etc.)?
- We will finish writing tests (before the next TA meeting)

# What went well?

- We wrote a lot of code, especially tests and made a good start on the report for the deadline of last Friday.
    - Betsie - Wrote report & Worked on Queue Randomizer
    - Christian - Tested & Worked on Queue Randomizer
    - Gonem - Tested Agenda & Worked on Time Randomizer
    - Janine - Worked on (tests for) database & Wrote report
    - Nils - Tested To-do-list & Wrote report
- A lot of things are pushed to main (on time)

# What could improve?

- Code-wise:
    - Gonems randomizer: Test runs infinitely long
    - Cris en Betsies randomizer: Has to be finished, output has to be perfectionised
        
        (might influence Nils part)
        
    - Report: Design pattern is something that we didn't really follow, but is seemed to be an import thing in the report. We should do something with this
    - Nils python does not work properly, he is trying to fix this before Wednesday
- We should check the board in GitLab more and update it as soon as we complete an issue.
- Follow TA's comments from last meeting!!!

# How do we proceed?

- Database should be finished (before Wednesday)
- Link agenda with randomizer
- Maybe add buttons, one button to add activity in agenda, one for adding task
- We have to start writing code for the Task status
- Merge everything before Tuesday afternoon
