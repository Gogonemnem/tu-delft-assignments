# What went well?

- All tasks were completed within the timeframe;
- The requirements have a more regular structure and give a more coherent overview of the final application;
- Everyone has a much better overview of the project, because the following points are clearer defined:
    - the required packages;
    - the programming structure;
    - the specific functionalities of the application;
    - the potential blockers;
    - what the application does not do;
    - who the targeted audience of this application is.

# What could improve?

- Attendance of everyone at all meetings;
- Following the recommended schedule;
- Preceding to the next step instead of overthinking small stuff;
- Lack of structure during meetings and planning of the project.

# How do we proceed?

- Reminders of meetings the day before
- Creating a long-term overview, per week an overview of what needs to be completed
- Assigning a scrum master to keep the overview and take matters in their hands to continue the discussion
- To have a clear planning and task assignment *before* the meeting starts.

## Questions for TA

- What is the next deadline?
- How the interpreter works with GitLab
