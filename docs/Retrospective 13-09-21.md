# What went well?

Initial cooperation within the team is going great. Following points in particular:

- Creativity during the brainstorming sessions
- Communication within the team is good
- Everyone is punctual and completes their objectives before the deadline
- There is a good amount of Humor within the group
- There is a lot of trust in each other's judgment

# What could improve?

Following aspect could improve:

- Easily distracted during meetings, due to getting to know each other
- The sprint was not spread out that well, almost everything was done in the meeting already. Therefore, not much was done in-between meetings.

# How do we proceed?

- The project is just beginning. In the coming week the framework of the project will be far more defined when the coding in Python starts. For now it is hard to see what specific programming steps are needed.
