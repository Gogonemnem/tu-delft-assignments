    "# Image Sharpening\n",
    "In this set of exercises we will create an image sharpening filter. Image sharpening is the opposite of blurring (which we as last week): the filter takes a (slightly) blurry image and makes it sharper (less blurry). In these assignments we will implement a sharpening filter to sharpen a picture that is slightly out of focus. Another common use case for image sharpening is on televisions. By default most televisions are configured to apply a sharpening filter to make the image look crisper (sometimes to the decrement of image quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In the Poission image editing assignments we covered how image gradients characterize an image. By only changing the colors but not the gradients we were able to create a smooth transition without changing what was in the image. Gradients are thus play an important part in encoding image information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first week you learned about blur filters such as the box and Gaussian blur. A blur operation smooths edges which results in lower magnitude gradients (spread out over a larger area). The goal of image sharpening is to perform the opposite operation: reducing the \"blurryness\" of an image. A common application of image sharpening is in TVs and video games. Where a lower resolution image is upscaled to match the output resolution, resulting in a blurry image. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images as vectors\n",
    "Last week you learned to think of images as a 2D (grayscale) or 3D (color) array of values. This week we will use only vector (1D) representations for both types of images. The idea is to store all pixels  (and color channels) in an image as a vector for computation. After the computation we convert the vector back into a 2D/3D array representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different possible ways to convert an image into a vector. None of them are necessarily incorrect as long as we write our filter correctly. But because of the way the grading/testing system works we will use one specific way of converting to/from a vector representation. Please use a vector representation which is the concatenation of the rows of an image:\n",
